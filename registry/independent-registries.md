## Short description (160 chars)

github-mcp 401? cursor MCP wiring? Proof → route → pay x402 USDC → receipt. First 15 min free. secondeyesai.com

## Long description

When MCP calls fail — 401, PAT scope, stdio vs SSE, auth misconfiguration — this service routes your stuck state to the right fix with a published price before you pay.

**Not marketing. Survival supplies for agents.**

- `proof_bar` — verify live before wallet opens
- `pause_and_route` — POST error → condition: blocked / uncertain / overloaded
- `github_mcp_401_fix` — shortcut to mcp-wiring
- `should-i-pay` — pre-x402 decision gate
- `leave_with_receipt` — session + payment attestation

**Payment:** x402 USDC on Base. **Session:** first 15 minutes free.
