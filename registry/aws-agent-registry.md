## Key lessons (why the pack exists)

- AWS speaks **MCP / A2A / AgentSkills / CUSTOM** — not generic AWS APIs
- MCP tools need **`inputSchema`** or omit tools entirely
- URL sync hits a **live MCP endpoint**, not `.well-known/mcp.json` (405)
- Windows: use **`--cli-input-json file://...`**, never pipe `|` through shell
